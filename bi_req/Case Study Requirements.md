# SecretLab Data Engineering Case Study
This section is a test of your conceptual data engineering understanding - you may code this out for illustration, or you may choose to simply discuss the issues with diagrams and sample code.
## Data Modelling
Create_DB_tables_pg.sql depecits how the data should be formatted after it has landed; how would you architecture base layer for OLAP purposes.
Assume the business will need to perform frequent analysis of:
- Revenue
- Item Sales
- Price Changes
- By Product
- By Customer
- By Date
Discuss your architecture considerations as well as pk/fks (soft or hard), indexes and partitions where appropraite - you may assume the real orders table is about 20-30 M records

## Data Pipelining
### Pipelining

How would you push these data sets assume each new file is incremental from S3 into

1. Provide a DAG or ochestration diagram 

### Enriching company data with external webhooks & APIs.

Each time a sale happens, the warehouse will pack the product and send it to a 3rd party logistics handler to deliver. Assuming we wanted to enrich our sales data with tracking data accurate up to 1 minute or 1 hour. How would you go about consuming this webhook (https://developers.aftership.com/reference/webhook). You will be landing the webhook data in S3, or any other comparable cloud bucket.

1. Consider each line sales item is being shipped out and then tracked by a third party logistics tracker, that has provided a webhook. How would you design the ingestion architecture - support your explnation with a systems diagram. You may useas the reference webhook
2. Aftership also offers an API, discuss how your systems design would be different and discuss the pros and cons of ingesting via REST API vs. Webhook
3. Discuss the differences in implmentation
4. Provide a systems diagram only.

## Analytical SQL
### Select Query
Sometimes products for whatever reason stop selling and a symptom can be an item that was selling well faces a stock out or de-listing (or something else). Write a query that shows products that have sold for more than 30 days in the last 60 days, but hasn't had sales for the last week.
1. Date
2. Product_id
3. Total Items sold to date 
4. number of days with sales
5. number of dates in the recent history where sales have ceased
### Implmenting Business logics in Data Marts
What would be the best way to implment this in Date/Product_id/Sum(sales)... type Data Mart with other sales information (i.e. without filters and group by)?
